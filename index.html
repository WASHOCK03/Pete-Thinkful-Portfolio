      <p>After graduating college, I became an art teacher and worked with
        beginners and professionals. I love art and my works have been
        featured in major art galleries across the globe. </p>

      <p>If you're looking to hire an artist or if you're an artist looking
        for a collaborator for your next project, please reach out! I'm so
        excited to work with other artists to create new art. </p>
