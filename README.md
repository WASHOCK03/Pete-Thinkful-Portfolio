Thanks to https://jennythinkful.github.io/pizza/ for this super cool, easy, and fun template!

This is my first real repo/project and as much as I love the notes, would love to be able to upload screenshots. 

At this time, my repo has four files and folders. Am looking forward to adding as knowledge of "Repos" expand.
